# Introduction

pgBackRest release numbers consist of two parts, major and minor. A major release may break compatibility with the prior major release, but v2 releases are fully compatible with v1 repositories and will accept all v1 options. Minor releases can include bug fixes and features but do not change the repository format and strive to avoid changing options and naming.

::: tip NOTE:
Documentation for the v1 release can be found [here](http://www.pgbackrest.org/1).

The notes for a release may also contain Additional Notes but changes in this section are only to documentation or the test suite and have no direct impact the on the pgBackRest codebase.
